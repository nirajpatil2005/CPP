types of binary trees

Types of tree
1->Generic tree:
    multiple children
2->Binary Tree:
    upto to child nodes
3->binary search trees:
    binary search trees with some special properties

 1 full binarytree= having 0 or 2 nodes
 2  perfect binary tree =every nodes has 2 childs except 
                     last level leaf nodes
 3 complete binary tree: last level is not completed
 4 balanced binary tree: for every node the diffrence between the levels
                         of LST and RST should be atmost 1
    LST=left sub tree RST-right sub tree
